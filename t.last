  content:
   [31m[1m"[0m[31mI'm currently facing challenges in integrating breakpoints into the swiper code. Despite my attempts, I have been unable to successfully implement the breakpoints, and it appears that the functionality is not working as expected. I'm reaching out to inquire if anyone else has encountered similar issues or if there are success stories regarding the implementation of breakpoints in this specific code. Any guidance or insights into resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated.[0m[31m[1m"[0m,

   [31m[1m"[0m[31mso basically I have a sidekiq worker and a Postgresql db. The worker is doing a few different things but to keep things simple it's using an ActiveRecord Transaction. Inside this Transaction is another Transaction that creates a model. The model has an after_commit callback that calls the reload method.[0m[31m[1m"[0m,

   [31m[1m"[0m[31mThis is simply a Dependency relation. You need to draw a dashed arrow from Cone to Flavor. This is because Flavor is an enumeration (the Mickeysoft or Eclipse notation you're using is wrong by the way, but you probably can't alter that except by staying away from the tool itself). The enumeration is used for balls to form an array of Flavors.[0m[31m[1m"[0m,
